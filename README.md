EASY EXPLAINED VERSION SETUP 
First, grab Roblox Account Manager (it helps manage accounts) and Bloxstrap (it smooths things out if you want). In Roblox Account Manager, go to settings and turn on multi-Roblox mode, so you can open more than one Roblox at once.

Log in to two accounts in the Account Manager: one main account (the one that gives commands) and one alt (the one that follows).

Now, you need a multi-instance executor it’s a tool to inject scripts into each Roblox client. Open both Roblox clients, inject the executor into each one, and load your script. In the executor, type your main account's name and hit execute.

You’ll see a command box pop up on the main account and a key box on the alt. Enter the key on the alt, and that’s it! Now, when you use commands on the main account, the alt will follow along. Enjoy the setup!
